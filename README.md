# -Pig-Game-
My first 2 Players Game
This is my second project from the "Complete JavaScript Course ...". This game is rolling dice based. Players try their luck accumulating points from dice and choose to HOLD them to their score. If you don't hold your points and continue rolling, you must dice 1 and then you lost your points and it's next player's turn. First who gets to 100 points win the game. 
Personal thoughts: I think it's really nice that the display looks like a pig's face, from which the name. 

Here are some SCREENSHOTS to see features of my project and my code:
